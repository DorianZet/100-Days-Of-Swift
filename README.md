This is a complete "100 Days of Swift" course, all challenges included.

I strongly recommend you to use this ONLY WHEN you really struggle - some of those challenges took me more than 1 day of heavy thinking and I recommend the same to you.

You might notice there are some personal touches of mine here and there, like camera shake in project 29 for example. Feel free to use those wherever you find suitable on your app - I believe that small details like this create more depth when using an app, and also they are not difficult to implement so they are a great way to practice coding.

Have fun!
