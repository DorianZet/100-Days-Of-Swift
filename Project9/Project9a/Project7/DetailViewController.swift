        //IMPORTANT: That 'guard' at the beginning unwraps 'detailItem' into itself if it has a value, which makes sure we exit the method if for some reason we didn't get any data passed into the detail view controller. TL;DR: If 'detailItem' doesn't have a value (for example, servers are offline), the code below won't be executed.
        
        // We can name this 'guard let' whatever we want, it doesn't have to be 'detailItem'. When you make it 'dupa', remember that below \(detailItem.body) has to be changed to \(dupa.body) as well. However, it's very common to unwrap variables using the same name, rather than create slight variations.
