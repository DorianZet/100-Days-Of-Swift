    // Determining whether a player can place a chip in a column. This method will return the first row number that contains no chips in a specific column. It works by counting up in a columm, from 0 up to the height of the board. For every slot, it calls 'chip(inColumn:row:)' to see what chip color is there already, and if it gets back '.none'' it means that row is good to use. If it gets to the end of the board without finding a '.none' it will return nil - this column has no free slots:

    // Some words from me, Mateusz: I understand that the 'score(for player:)' method is the key to the AI's effective work - the more details we provide it (adding/taking away certain amounts of points in different cases), the more effective AI will be. For example - adding some points for 2 chips in row, 3 chips in row etc.
