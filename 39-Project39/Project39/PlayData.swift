It keeps track of how many times items you tried to add and remove each item, which means it can handle de-duplicating our words while storing how often they are used (so we don't have to use the dicitionary 'wordCounts = [String: Int]()' anymore).
    private(set) var filteredWords = [String]() // that marks the setter of 'filteredWords' - the code that handles writing - as private, which means ONLY CODE INSIDE THE 'PlayData' CLASS CAN USE IT. The getter - the code that handles reading - is unaffected.

                allWords = plays.components(separatedBy: CharacterSet.alphanumerics.inverted) // we split the text in "plays.text" by splitting on anything that ISN'T a letter or number, which can be achieved by inverting the alphanumeric character set.
                allWords = allWords.filter { $0 != ""} // filter all empty lines from the 'allWords' array and remove them.
                
                wordCounts = NSCountedSet(array: allWords) // creates a counted set from all the words, which immediately de-duplicates and counts them all.
//              allWords = wordCounts.allObjects as! [String] // updates the 'allWords' array to be the words from the counted set, this ensuring they are unique.
                let sorted = wordCounts.allObjects.sorted { wordCounts.count(for: $0) > wordCounts.count(for: $1) } // sort the array so that the most frequent words appear at the top of the table. The closure needs to accept two strins ($0 and $1) and needs to return true if the first string coems before the second. We call 'count(for:)' on each of those strings, so this code will return true ("sort before") if the count for $0 is higher than the code for $1.
                allWords = sorted as! [String]

            applyFilter { self.wordCounts.count(for: $0) >= userNumber } // creates an array out of words with a count greater or equal to the number the user entered. $0 here means "every word in 'allWords'.

We may read it as "give me all words from 'allWords' array that have an 'input' string in their range.
        }
    }
    
    func applyFilter(_ filter: (String) -> Bool) { // this function accepts a single parameter, which must be a function that takes a string and returns a boolean. This is exactly what 'filter()' wants, so we can just pass that parameter straight on:
